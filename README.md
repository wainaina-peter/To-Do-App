# To-Do-App
Here is a to do app that I created and employed React components and hooks. It was a nice project as it made me conversant with React hooks: useState, useEffect  and also the use of props.
I have connected the ToDo app project to Firebase cloudstore database and 
one can perform CRUD operations on it.
